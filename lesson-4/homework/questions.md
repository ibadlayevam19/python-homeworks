With continue we can stop current iteration of the loop and go to the next iteration straightly. And with break statement we can stop whole loop and exit from it.
In for loop you will give the range for iterations, when it is out of range it will exit the loop. In while loop we will give some condition and when condition no longer satisfies it will exit the loop.
In nested for loop inner loop is executed completely for each iteration of outer loop. We can use nested loop for 2d systems like matrices, grids, permutations.
